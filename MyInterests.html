<h1> * What I like to do in my free time * </h1>
<p> In my free time I love to run, watch TV, play with my pets, and sadly I also have to work </p>
<h3> <u> Running </u> </h3>
  <p> In my spare time I like to run with a great team called Students Run CHicago </p>

  <p> I have been running since my junior year of highschool, when I did my first half marathon with CARA students, it was then that the program closed and SRC(Students Run Chicago) came to be. I actually ran with the people who created SRC and was invited to continue running with them and proceed to run a marathon. At first I was very scared.... because its a MARATHON!</p>
  <p>Later that year when I was back in school, I decided to join the track team and went on to feel amazing during EVERY run.. even the long ones! so I decided that would be the year (2016) I would run it.</p>
  <p> Since then I have ran many 5/10k's and 4 half marathons, and only 2 marathons. </p>
  <p> I am sad I will not be running this year but for the first time ever I will get to see the marathon runners from the volunteers side and I wish every runner the best!</p>

<p> As you can see I have more than one show I am currently watching() without counting all the ones I forgot) and I am also in love with watching movies! I think it's because since I was younger watching tv as a familiy was our little family tradition and now even though we don't do so I sitll make the time to catch up and de-stress. </p>
