            My name is Kelly Perez, and I am 20 years old.  I was born in Morelia, Mich. That is a state in Mexico. I moved here when I was almost 10 years old, knowing no english and had only been here once for vacations. It was scary at first, creating basically a new life, but it was definitely worth it!

            I attended Sarah E. Goode STEM Academy for High School and had a dual enrollement at Richard J. Daley College. I truly loved getting to have that experience and opportunity because it gave me an insight into what college life kind of was, and get used to the work load. I then received my associates in Computer Science and transfered to IIT. I first started out as a CIS Major and just transfered into ITM this semester.
