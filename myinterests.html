        <h2> * What I like to do in my free time * </h2>
          <p> 
           In my free time I love to run, watch TV, play with my pets, and sadly I also have to work 
          </p>
        <h3> Running </h3>
          <p>
            In my spare time I like to run with a great team called Students Run CHicago 
          </p>
          <img class="img2" src="pictures/src.jpg" alt="src">
          <p> 
            I have been running since my junior year of highschool, when I did my first half marathon with CARA students, it was then that the program closed and SRC(Students Run Chicago) came to be. I actually ran with the people who created SRC and was invited to continue running with them and proceed to run a marathon. At first I was very scared.... because its a MARATHON!
          </p>
          <p>
            Later that year when I was back in school, I decided to join the track team and went on to feel amazing during EVERY run.. even the long ones! so I decided that would be the year (2016) I would run it.
          </p>
          <p>
          Since then I have ran many 5/10k's and 4 half marathons, and only 2 marathons.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am sad I will not be running this year but for the first time ever I will get to see the marathon runners from the volunteers side and I wish every runner the best!
          </p>
        <h3> What I am currently watching  </h3>
          <p> I am currently watching MANY shows!!</p>
          <p> Some of my favorite ones at the moment are: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Shameless</li>
              <li>The office</li>
              <li> MED shows: Greys Anatomy, The Resident, The good doctor</li>
              <li> Glimore Girls </li>
              <li> The bold type </li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            As you can see I have more than one show I am currently watching() without counting all the ones I forgot) and I am also in love with watching movies! I think it's because since I was younger watching tv as a familiy was our little family tradition and now even though we don't do so I sitll make the time to catch up and de-stress.
          </p>
